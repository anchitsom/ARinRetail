# ARinRetail

Online shopping provides convenience, minimal setup costs and limitless inventory for retailers. While Physical stores provide an interactive and intuitive environment for customers to view products. This report explores the opportunity present in the two markets and proposes a hybrid shopping experience enabled by Augmented Reality technology. The vision would be manifested as an iOS based AR application for convenient viewing. The project aims to create a working e-commerce platform within the time frame of ten months that serves both customers and retailers.
